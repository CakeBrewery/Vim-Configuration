# Vim-Configuration
My personal Vim configuration so I can fetch it whenever I need it


## Quick use
Careful if you already have a .vimrc file on your $HOME directory, as this may try to override it. 

* `git clone https://github.com/CakeBrewery/Vim-Configuration.git && cd Vim-Configuration && ln -s $(pwd)/vimrc $HOME/.vimrc`
